## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
In Singapore shuttle services to ferry students from their home to school and back is quite common. Probably every Singaporean would have travelled in a shuttle service during their student days.
Our team of 4 Singapore residents have also gone through the process of selecting shuttle services for our school going children and the biggest challenge we found was to find a service which takes the shortest distance to reach the school from our house at a reasonable cost. 
We believe that many other Singapore parents would also be finding similar difficulties in selecting shuttle services for their children, so to address this gap in the market we decided to embark on this project. In this project we are assuming that we are a service provider with a few depots and shuttle buses at our disposal. We would be providing shuttle services optimized through the implementation tools of Drools and OptaPlanner learnt during our machine learning and reasoning system modules. 
We felt that the scale and scope of the project was such that many more options for optimization could have been explored e.g. the amount of time taken between two locations, however given the time limitations we were happy with the solution we were able to provide here.

## SECTION 5 : USER GUIDE
IRS((Intelligent Rapid Shuttle) is a web based shuttle services optimizer. It would be used by the service provider to achieve the shortest overall distance between locations. The routes would be shown visually on the google map to enable the service provider to navigate easily.
